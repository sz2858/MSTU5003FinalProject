## Illustration


-- The overall design is based on my former assignments on developing my own educational website: UTOPIA. This website is aiming at fun learning. So at the very beginning, I created several animations to arouse students' interest.

-- The whole learning aims to provide children a more fun experience in computer programming. By leading students to explore the info courses, students can use the slides to learn the first lesson: some basics about coding. 

-- Then, the students can turn on to a short story/activity to explore how robots work.

-- The quiz will help students to memorize what they've learnt after a certain time. The quiz is similar to a daily challenge which students will conquer it everyday.

-- Also, I include a Google Survey to hear from students' feedback toward the website, which is also a great opportunity to find out more new ideas. Anyway, I hope everybody can enjoying coding!
